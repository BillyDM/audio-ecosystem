The rust audio ecosystem is rather fragmented. The authors of multiple large rust
audio engines are to come together try and unify the audio crate ecosystem.

We are at an early beginning. The text on this repo is by the author (@dvdsk), should be seen as a *rough* draft. It will change over time with input from others.

## State
We are currently working on:
- defining the goals of the effort [discussion here]()
- planning a demo which will compare audio engines [discussion here]()
